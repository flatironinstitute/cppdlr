``cppdlr``: Imaginary time calculations using the discrete Lehmann representation
=================================================================================

``cppdlr`` is a C++ library implementing the discrete Lehmann representation (DLR) of
imaginary time single-particle Green's functions and other imaginary time
quantities, including standard operations. It can be downloaded `from GitHub <https://github.com/flatironinstitute/cppdlr>`_.

The DLR has been implemented in other programming languages (see the :ref:`related libraries<otherlibraries>` below). 
``cppdlr`` offers a particularly simple high-level user interface, enabled by
the use of C++ templating and the `nda library <https://github.com/TRIQS/nda>`_ for array types and BLAS/LAPACK
compatibility. This facilitates its use both in small-scale applications and in
existing large-scale software projects such as the `TRIQS library
<https://triqs.github.io>`_ for quantum many-body calculations, which has
incorporated the DLR via ``cppdlr``. 

Getting started
---------------

  - Install the library by following the instructions on the :ref:`installation page<install>`.
  - If you are unfamiliar with the DLR, you can read the :ref:`background page<background>` for a
    brief introduction, or the references below for more detail. If you are
    familiar with the DLR, you should still take a brief look at the
    :ref:`background page<background>` for important information about the library.
  - To begin using ``cppdlr`` in your application, the :ref:`examples page<examples>` provides a
    good starting point.
  - If you need more specific information about ``cppdlr`` classes and functions,
    take a look at the :ref:`reference documentation page<documentation>`.
