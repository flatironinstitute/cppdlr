_abstract = {We consider the numerical solution of the real-time equilibrium Dyson equation, which is used in calculations of the dynamical properties of quantum many-body systems. We show that this equation can be written as a system of coupled, nonlinear, convolutional Volterra integro-differential equations, for which the kernel depends self-consistently on the solution. As is typical in the numerical solution of Volterra-type equations, the computational bottleneck is the quadratic-scaling cost of history integration. However, the structure of the nonlinear Volterra integral operator precludes the use of standard fast algorithms. We propose a quasilinear-scaling FFT-based algorithm which respects the structure of the nonlinear integral operator. The resulting method can reach large propagation times and is thus well-suited to explore quantum many-body phenomena at low energy scales. We demonstrate the solver with two standard model systems: the Bethe graph and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.},

abstract = {We introduce sparse-ir, a collection of libraries to efficiently handle imaginary-time propagators, a central object in finite-temperature quantum many-body calculations. We leverage two concepts: firstly, the intermediate representation (IR), an optimal compression of the propagator with robust a priori error estimates, and secondly, sparse sampling, near-optimal grids in imaginary time and imaginary frequency from which the propagator can be reconstructed and on which diagrammatic equations can be solved. IR and sparse sampling are packaged into stand-alone, easy-to-use Python, Julia and Fortran libraries, which can readily be included into existing software. We also include an extensive set of sample codes showcasing the library for typical many-body and ab initio methods.}
